# TAFormatConvert
Project for converting face aligment labels and metadata from TXT files to XML files. 

The project is thought for converting face rects and facial landmarks from TXT files to XML files, for example, used in the DLIB library to train its Face Landmark Detector ( http://blog.dlib.net/2018/01/correctly-mirroring-datasets.html ).
